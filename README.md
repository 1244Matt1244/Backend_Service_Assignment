# MTG Backend Service

This is a backend service for managing Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards and traffic cameras. It provides endpoints to list, retrieve, import, and manage MTG cards, as well as to handle traffic camera data.

## Features

- **MTG Cards Management:**
  - List all MTG cards
  - Get details of a specific MTG card by ID
  - Import MTG cards from an external API

- **Traffic Cameras Management:**
  - List all traffic cameras
  - Get details of a specific traffic camera by ID
  - Add a new traffic camera
  - Delete a traffic camera

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
- PostgreSQL database

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup the Database

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and set up a database. You will need to create the following tables in your database:

#### MTG Cards Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE mtg_cards (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    mana_cost VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    UNIQUE (id)
);
```

#### Traffic Cameras Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE traffic_cameras (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    url VARCHAR(255)
);
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Set up the environment variables for database connection in your `.env` file or export them directly in your shell:

```bash
export DB_USER="your_db_user"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_db_password"
export DB_NAME="your_db_name"
export DB_HOST="localhost"
export DB_PORT="5432"
```

### 3. Run the Application

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mtg-backend-service.git
cd mtg-backend-service
```

Install Go dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

Build and run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port `8080`.

## API Endpoints

### MTG Cards Endpoints

  - `GET /mtg-cards`
  - Returns a list of all MTG cards.

- **Get MTG Card by ID**
  - `GET /mtg-card/{id}`
  - Returns details of a specific MTG card by ID.

- **Import MTG Cards**
  - `POST /mtg-cards/import`
  - Imports MTG cards from the Magic: The Gathering API.

### Traffic Cameras Endpoints

- **Get Traffic Camera by ID**
  - `GET /camera?id={id}`
  - Returns details of a specific traffic camera by ID.

- **Add a New Traffic Camera**
